# scaffold
This is a simple setup of a new mac development environment

#Running
Note: I recommend forking this repo in case you don't like anything I do and want to set your own preferences (and pull request them!)

```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ds-matt/dotBot/master/install.sh | sh
```

Next use the run command:

```
./scaffold.sh
```

Note: running scaffold.sh is idempotent. You can run it again and again as you add new features or software to the scripts!
